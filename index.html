      <h2>What is Restless Motives?</h2>
      
      <p> My name is Travaughn Watson and I am the creator of Restless Motives Apparel, LLC. 
         Restless Motives was created in the heart of the pandemic in 2021. 
         You may ask where did I get the name from or why would I name a brand that out of all things. 
         Well, the answer is quite simple to me. Between my undiagnosed ADHD and inability to focus on one thing at time, my mind is indeed <i>restless</i>. 
         I am always thinking about the next thing, accomplishment, design, the future. Honestly, I can't stop and I wont stop progressing. 
      The definition of Restless Motives is being unabe to rest or relax as a result of the significant urge to succeed. 
      My wife made the first investment in my business by gifting me the funds to purchase a heat press and I was off onto a new journey.  </p>

      <p>
         I always knew I wanted to become some type of designer and business owner from a very young age. At the age of four or five, 
         I developed an hobby of creating homes and structures out of paper, cardboard, and anything else I could find around the house.
          I realized I had a certain profeciency in drawing and other artsy types of things. I would draw and reimagine Nike/Jordan brand shoes. 
          I wish I still had these images but I'm afraid they may be long gone. As early as middle school, my art teachers seen that I understood art and design. 
          One of my teachers made me a class assist in art class which was pretty cool. I went on to major in Architecture at the University of Missouri - Kansas City. 
          I was enrolled in this program for a year but realized after that first year that sitting in a studio for 
          8-10 hours a day (or more) designing buildings with so many constraints just wasnt my passion. 
          I changed my major to Business Marketing after my freshman year and began creating my brand.

      <h2>What's so fun about being a business owner?</h2>

         The best aspect of being a brand owner is the freedom to do whatever the hell you want. 
         It's obvious you need people to buy your products to be a profitable business and to continue operation but I have the power to produce or not. However, everything is still within the scope of my mind and ideas. 
          I get to show the world how is it that I think about art and certain aspects of life within the clothing I create. Photoshoots are really fun and it's an opportunity to network with some of the best photographers in the city.
          One of the most satisfying aspect of being a brand owner that I've done so far is working with a local non-for-profit. 
          The non-for-profit is called Show Me The World and I have worked with them multiple times to create garments they sell to raise money for funding study abroad trips for teenagers in St. Louis.

      <h2>The Future of Restless Motives Apparel</h2>
      <img src ="c:\Users\alexi\Downloads\building.jpg" alt = "building">

      <p> 

         The future of Restless Motive Apparel, LLC is endless. I will eventually create
         a non-for-profit and use grants to construct a facility in the neighborhood I grew up in. This faciliy will be for children in the area to come and learn art, design, and media. 
         I plan to have local artist, teachers, and business owners to regularly teach and assist scholars in building skills to be successful in their artistry. 
         I want to remain an indepedent brand owner but, produce collaboration with other known brands. 
         Lastly, I will add an ascept of media to my company by creating advertisements, short films, and maybe even a podcast or  in the future.
